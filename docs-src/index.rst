BioSimulators-RBApy documentation
=====================================

BioSimulators-RBApy provides a `BioSimulators <https://biosimulators.org>`_-compliant command-line interface to the `RBApy <https://sysbioinra.github.io/RBApy/>`_ tool for Resource Balance Analysis (RBA) simulations. A Docker image for this package is also available.

This command-line interface and Docker image enable users to use RBApy to execute `COMBINE/OMEX archives <https://combinearchive.org/>`_ that describe one or more simulation experiments (in `SED-ML format <https://sed-ml.org>`_) of one or more RBA models in the `RBApy format <https://sysbioinra.github.io/RBApy/usage.html>`_.

A list of the algorithms and algorithm parameters supported by RBApy is available at `BioSimulators <https://biosimulators.org/simulators/rbapy>`_.

A simple web application and web service for using RBApy to execute COMBINE/OMEX archives is also available at `runBioSimulations <https://run.biosimulations.org>`_.
